I am a first-year PhD student in Marketing at Michigan State University's Eli Broad College of Business. My research focuses on modeling, digital marketing, customer satisfaction, policy through empirical analysis.

## Research Interests

My research leverages quantitative methods to analyze marketing phenomena, with particular emphasis on:

* **Digital Marketing Analytics**: Analyzing promotion strategies and their impact on consumer behavior
* **Media Channel Effectiveness**: Evaluating ROI across media channels through econometric modeling
* **Customer Satisfaction Modeling**: Quantifying factors that drive satisfaction and retention

## Current Research

I'm currently working on projects examining promotion effectiveness on e-commerce platforms, media spending allocation optimization, and customer preference modeling in service industries.

## Background

Prior to my PhD, I completed an M.S. in Marketing Research at Michigan State University and an M.S. in Management Business Analytics and Intelligence at Case Western Reserve University, building a strong foundation in both marketing theory and quantitative methods.
