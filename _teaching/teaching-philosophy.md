# Teaching Philosophy Statement

## Evidence-Based Marketing Education for Diverse Learners

## Core Teaching Philosophy

My teaching philosophy centers on **evidence-based marketing education** that combines systematic assessment design with inclusive collaborative learning. Rather than relying on assumptions about student capabilities or preferences, I use data to understand how students learn and continuously refine my pedagogical approaches based on empirical evidence.

This philosophy evolved significantly through my Mentored Teaching Project, which revealed that **how we assess collaborative work matters more than how we form groups**. This fundamental insight shifted my focus from student selection strategies to assessment design excellence, emphasizing that effective teaching requires rigorous evaluation of our own practices, not just our students' performance.

## Principles of Effective Marketing Education

### 1. Assessment-Driven Course Design

My approach prioritizes valid, reliable assessment that accurately measures student learning rather than administrative convenience. Through my research, I discovered that poorly designed rubrics can create ceiling effects that mask student differences and prevent meaningful feedback.

**In Practice**: I design assessments with appropriate discrimination levels, multiple measurement points, and clear alignment between learning objectives and evaluation methods. For group work, this means using random group formation (rather than attitude-based selection) while including individual accountability measures to preserve collaborative learning benefits.

### 2. Evidence-Based Pedagogical Decisions

Every significant teaching decision should be supported by data about student learning outcomes. My Mentored Teaching Project demonstrated that common assumptions about group formation (matching students by attitudes) lack empirical support, leading to more effective random assignment strategies.

**In Practice**: I systematically collect student feedback, analyze performance patterns, and adjust course design based on evidence rather than tradition or convenience. This includes pre-course surveys, mid-semester evaluations, and post-course analysis of learning outcomes.

### 3. Inclusive Collaboration for Professional Preparation

Marketing professionals work in diverse, cross-functional teams. My courses prepare students for this reality by creating inclusive collaborative environments that support learners from different academic backgrounds, cultural contexts, and comfort levels with business concepts.

**In Practice**: I provide multiple format options for assignments (written analysis, video presentations, infographics), use structured discussion protocols that encourage all voices, and implement clear communication frameworks that support both native and non-native English speakers.

### 4. Systematic Organization Supporting Learning

Students consistently recognize organization and clear communication as crucial for their success, as evidenced in their feedback: "very organized and well put together," "expectations to excel in the course were clearly outlined," and "I like how it was extremely clear what we were responsible for each week, and that it had a fair workload." This systematic approach reflects marketing's emphasis on clarity, strategic planning, and systematic execution - professional skills that mirror effective course design.

**Evidence from Student Evaluations**: My MKT 327 course received high ratings for organization (4.33/5.0) and clear expectations (4.42/5.0), with students noting "Teacher was amazing with communication" and appreciating "the communication and how its format" supported their learning.

**In Practice**: I provide detailed weekly schedules, transparent grading rubrics, timely feedback on assignments, and multiple communication channels. Students know what is expected each week and receive support for meeting those expectations.

## Approach to Student Engagement

### Three-Dimensional Engagement Strategy

Based on workshop learning about behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement, I design marketing courses that address all three dimensions:

**Behavioral Engagement**: Students actively participate through discussion boards, peer commentary on case analyses, and structured group roles (team leader, company analysts, editor/integrator).

**Emotional Engagement**: I connect marketing concepts to students' personal interests through surveys and reflective activities, helping them see relevance to their career goals and current experiences.

**Cognitive Engagement**: Case studies require students to apply marketing frameworks to real business problems, moving beyond memorization to analytical thinking and strategic reasoning.

### Technology Integration for Learning Enhancement

Technology serves learning objectives rather than existing for its own sake. My multimodal approach provides synchronous collaboration opportunities while maintaining asynchronous accessibility for diverse schedules and time zones.

**Strategic Technology Use**: D2L discussion forums for peer learning, multiple digital format options for group presentations, and flexible collaboration tools that accommodate different technological comfort levels while building professional digital communication skills.

## Creating Inclusive Learning Environments

### Supporting Diverse Student Backgrounds

As an international instructor teaching diverse student populations, I recognize that marketing students arrive with varying levels of business knowledge, analytical preparation, and collaborative experience. My inclusive approach provides multiple entry points to challenging concepts.

**Inclusive Practices**:
- Multiple format options for demonstrating knowledge (accommodating different strengths)
- Clear scaffolding from basic concepts to strategic application
- Regular check-ins and feedback mechanisms to gauge classroom climate
- International marketing examples that expose students to global perspectives

### Equity-Conscious Assessment

My research revealed that assessment design significantly impacts which students appear successful. I work to create fair evaluation systems that measure learning rather than reflecting pre-existing advantages.

**Equity Measures**: Individual accountability within group work, multiple opportunities to demonstrate mastery, transparent grading criteria, and assessment formats that don't penalize students for factors unrelated to marketing knowledge.

## Professional Development and Growth Mindset

### Continuous Improvement Through Research

My teaching practice integrates ongoing inquiry into student learning effectiveness. The Mentored Teaching Project exemplifies this commitment - when I observed unexpected patterns in group work, I designed systematic research to understand and improve my practices.

**Research-Informed Teaching**: Regular analysis of student performance patterns, systematic collection of feedback data, and willingness to change proven ineffective practices based on evidence.

### Institutional Mission Alignment

My teaching aligns with MSU's land-grant mission by providing accessible, practical marketing education that serves diverse student populations. This means balancing theoretical frameworks with real-world applications while maintaining high academic standards.

**Mission Integration**: Clear learning objectives connected to practical marketing skills, emphasis on collaborative problem-solving that mirrors professional environments, and accessible teaching methods that support student success regardless of background.

## Future Teaching Applications

### Short-Term Implementation (Current Academic Year)

Based on my research findings and workshop learning:
- Implement revised group work rubrics with appropriate discrimination levels
- Continue using random group formation strategies (rather than attitude-based selection) supported by my research evidence
- Add individual accountability measures within collaborative assignments
- Continue systematic data collection on student learning outcomes

### Long-Term Professional Development

- Contribute to marketing education literature through publication of collaborative learning assessment research
- Develop expertise in inclusive pedagogy that supports international students and diverse learners
- Build connections between marketing education practice and broader scholarship of teaching and learning

## Conclusion

My teaching philosophy emphasizes evidence-based decision making, inclusive collaboration, and systematic assessment design in marketing education. This approach ensures that pedagogical choices serve student learning rather than instructor convenience, creates equitable opportunities for diverse learners to demonstrate knowledge, and prepares students for the collaborative, data-driven reality of modern marketing practice.

The integration of research, reflection, and continuous improvement makes my teaching practice a scholarly endeavor that contributes to both student success and the broader marketing education community. This philosophy will continue evolving as I gather more evidence about effective teaching practices while maintaining its core commitment to inclusive, evidence-based marketing education.
