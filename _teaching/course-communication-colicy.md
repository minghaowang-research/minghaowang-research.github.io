# MKT 327 Course Communication Policy - Summer 2025
## Asynchronous Online Learning Environment

**Instructor:** Minghao Wang | **Email:** wangmi18@msu.edu  
**Note:** This policy is designed for asynchronous online courses.
**Important:** Always refer to the course syllabus first for the most current information. The syllabus may be updated throughout the semester, while this communication policy may not reflect the latest changes.

As an online marketing learning community, our goal is to communicate professionally and in ways that help everyone develop deeper understanding of marketing concepts. The guidelines below will help us accomplish this goal:

## Basic Communication Standards

1. **Use professional language appropriate for business education.** Practice the communication skills you'll need in marketing careers.

2. **Do not post anything online that you would feel uncomfortable saying in a professional meeting.** Remember that marketing is a relationship-based industry.

3. **Always proofread your posts and emails before submitting.** Clear communication is essential in marketing.

4. **Check D2L daily (including weekends) for group messages and announcements.** Respond to group members within 48 hours.

**Note:** If your communication involves inappropriate language or tone, you will receive one written warning. The same applies to academic dishonesty. After this warning, further inappropriate communication will impact your participation grade.

## Group Discussion Standards

In group case study discussions, demonstrate productive communication by:

**Strong Discussion Examples:**
- *"Nike's target market segmentation focuses on athletes aged 18-35, which differs from Mayo Clinic's patient-centered approach because their value propositions serve completely different needs."*
- *"Building on the Louis Vuitton analysis, their exclusivity strategy creates artificial scarcity that increases perceived value, as discussed in Chapter 10."*
- *"I disagree with the pricing strategy conclusion - Uber's surge pricing data from the case suggests customers accept higher prices during peak demand periods."*

**What Makes Communication Productive:**
- Specific references to case study companies and marketing concepts
- Clear connections between theory and business examples  
- Respectful disagreement that advances understanding
- Questions that help the group think more deeply

## Working in Groups (14 Groups of 5 Students)

Throughout this course, you'll collaborate on case study analyses. When working in groups:

1. **Contact your group members via D2L group/email within 48 hours** of groups being assigned.

2. **Use initial time to assign company responsibilities** (each member analyzes one company), set timeline, and plan final submission.

3. **Ensure equal contribution** from all group members through clear role assignments.

4. **Submit individual contributions on time** so the group can compile final analysis.

5. **Contact me if group communication problems arise** or if members aren't participating fairly.

## Peer Evaluation Process

At the end of this course, you'll complete a peer evaluation form rating group members' contributions. This is used for grading purposes to ensure fair participation assessment. 

## Communicating with Your Instructor

When communicating with me, please follow these guidelines:

**Email Communication (Primary Method):**
- Use subject line format: "MKT 327 - [Brief Topic]"
- Contact me at least 24 hours before assignment deadlines with questions
- Include your full name and specific details about your question
- For grade discussions, reference the specific assignment and rubric criteria

**Extensions and Late Work:**
- Email me at least 48 hours before deadlines if you need an extension
- Emergency situations require immediate contact
- Late work penalty: 5 points per day

**Response Expectations:**
- Respond to my emails within 48 hours
- Be specific about assignment questions rather than asking general "how do I do this?" questions

## How I Will Communicate with You

**My Commitments:**
- Respond to all emails within 24 hours (including weekends)
- Post weekly D2L announcements every Sunday night or Monday
- Help resolve group communication issues when needed

**Communication Channels:**
- **Email:** Individual questions, grade discussions, personal support
- **D2L Announcements:** Course updates, deadline reminders, clarifications  
- **D2L Gradebook:** Assignment grades and detailed feedback

## Individual Case Study Reflections

After each group case study, you'll submit individual reflections (150-250 words) choosing from options focusing on:
- Marketing strategy analysis and theory application
- Customer value insights and competitive positioning
- Group collaboration experience and personal learning

These reflections help you process marketing concepts personally

## Format

**Summer Asynchronous Format:** Designed to accommodate working students and summer interns with flexible timing but clear expectations.

## Institutional Policies

This communication policy aligns with:
- **MSU Academic Integrity Policy:** Honest individual and collaborative work (https://ossa.msu.edu/academic-integrity)
- **Broad College Honor Code:** Eli Broad College of Business Undergraduate Honor Code  (https://broad.msu.edu/undergraduate/policies/honor-code/)
