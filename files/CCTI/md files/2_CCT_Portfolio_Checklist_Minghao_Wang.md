PART 4 - TEACHING PHILOSOPHY

Your teaching philosophy is an evolving document in which you articulate your experiences, beliefs, and values of teaching. This is a personal document and thus, there is no formula for what must be included in it. It should, however, reflect you and your critical thinking about your teaching practice.
