## CCT Competency 4: Understanding the University Context

## Workshop Details

Workshop: CCTI "Understanding the University Context—Aligning Teaching w/ Different Institutional Types \& Missions"
Facilitator: Dr. Judith Stoddart (Associate Provost for University Arts and Collections)
Date: Thursday, May 8, 2025 (9:15-10:15 a.m.)
Breakout Session: "Understanding the University Context - Developing Your Teaching Philosophy" (10:30 a.m.-noon)

## Competency Description

Understanding the University Context involves navigating the college and university institutional environment to maximize ability to cultivate student learning. This includes identifying partners, resources, and governance structures, as well as understanding faculty rights, roles, and responsibilities. The competency also encompasses teaching as research and professional development, and developing a professional teaching presence and plan.

## Workshop Experience \& Key Concept

The workshop emphasized that "Teaching is Context Sensitive" with three critical dimensions:

- Where? - Understanding institutional type and mission
- For whom? - Recognizing diverse student populations
- About what? - Aligning disciplinary content with institutional goals


## Artifacts \& Materials Developed

## Workshop Reflection Document

My comprehensive reflection identified specific skills and techniques I learned:

## 1. Institutional Alignment Skills:

- Creating clear learning goals specific to marketing education that align with university mission
- Connecting teaching methods directly to learning objectives within institutional framework
- Developing assessments that align with goals and marketing discipline priorities


## 2. Inclusive Teaching Within Institution:

- Incorporating inclusive approaches for diverse student backgrounds characteristic of MSU's land-grant mission
- Using reflective practice to identify effective and ineffective teaching moments within institutional context


## 3. Technology Integration Strategy:

- Integrating technology meaningfully to enhance learning rather than as an end itself, aligned with institutional resources and support


## Applied Teaching Philosophy Development

## Specific Applications to MKT 327 (from my reflection):

- Design MKT 327 with specific, measurable learning goals for marketing knowledge
- Create assessments that directly measure these specific learning goals
- Identify challenging marketing concepts and develop targeted teaching strategies
- Implement mid-semester evaluations to make timely adjustments
- Use data analysis demonstrations strategically to illustrate marketing concepts
- Select case studies that show how data influences marketing decisions
- Provide multiple ways for students to engage with challenging marketing content

## Areas for Future Investigation

My reflection identified ongoing uncertainties requiring further development:

- Effective pedagogical techniques specific to teaching marketing concepts
- Strategies for addressing students with varying levels of quantitative preparation
- More varied formative assessment approaches for marketing courses
- Finding the right balance between marketing theory and practical applications
- Addressing potential language and cultural barriers as an international instructor
- Better methods to evaluate if teaching approaches achieve stated goals


## Artifact Rationale

The workshop materials and my detailed reflection demonstrate sophisticated understanding that effective teaching requires alignment between personal teaching philosophy, disciplinary needs, and institutional mission. My systematic approach to course organization and clear communication reflects MSU's values of accessible, high-quality education while serving the diverse student body characteristic of land-grant universities.

My specific applications to MKT 327 show how "context sensitivity" translates to concrete teaching decisions - from measurable learning goals to strategic use of data demonstrations to multiple engagement pathways for diverse learners. The reflection reveals my deep thinking
about how institutional context shapes both what I teach and how I teach it. I also gave students a whole week to complete the exam so they can pick their own time, and this policy also can fit different time zones.

## Interpretation \& Reflection

## Key Learning Outcomes

Institutional Mission Awareness: Understanding how MSU's land-grant mission shapes expectations for accessible, practical education influences my marketing course design choices.

Resource Navigation: Learning to identify and utilize university resources for teaching support, including Graduate School professional development offerings and college-level coordination. As well as mental health support: MAET and MALXD Resources for Student Health, Identity, and Wellness (Adopted from MAET and MALXD Programs)

## My Revisited Online Teaching Manifesto（Updated Aug 2025）

## Who I Am：Personal and Professional Context

My name is Minghao Wang，a first－year PhD student（started in Fall 2024）in Marketing at Michigan State University．My educational journey spans multiple institutions and countries， giving me diverse perspectives on learning and teaching．I earned two Bachelor＇s degrees from MSU－one in Supply Chain Management and in Psychology．I also hold two Master＇s degrees： an M．S．in Marketing Research from MSU and an M．S．in Management Business Analytics and Intelligence from Case Western Reserve University（CWRU）．

My international experience includes studying abroad at the University of Kent in the United Kingdom（Canterbury）for one semester during my psychology studies．As someone originally from China now studying in the United States，I bring multicultural perspectives to my teaching． This diverse background helps me understand how students from different cultures and educational systems approach learning．

These varied educational experiences have given me multiple angles of understanding what students like and dislike．I have been an undergraduate student at MSU，experienced different teaching styles at CWRU，and adapted to British educational approaches during my semester abroad．I understand the challenges of navigating different academic systems and cultural expectations around learning．

Before entering my doctoral program，I worked in procurement and data analysis at CWRU， where I learned how to solve complex problems and communicate findings clearly．My background in marketing research has taught me the importance of understanding your audience．Just as successful marketing campaigns require deep knowledge of consumer behavior，effective teaching requires understanding how students learn．

This summer，I taught MKT 327 （Introduction to Marketing）for the first time．My class was completely asynchronous（July 1 －Aug 15，2025），serving third－year college students who juggle coursework with jobs and other responsibilities．This teaching opportunity represented a new chapter in my professional development，and taking CEP 820 alongside teaching helped me apply what I was learning immediately．

## My Course Design：Guided by Evidence and Student Voices

## Course Communication Policy

## MKT 327 Course Communication Policy－Summer 2025

## Asynchronous Online Learning Environment

Instructor：Minghao Wang｜Email：wangmi18＠msu．edu
Note：This policy is designed for asynchronous online courses．
Important：Always refer to the course syllabus first for the most current information．The syllabus may be updated throughout the semester，while this communication policy may not reflect the latest changes．

As an online marketing learning community，our goal is to communicate professionally and in ways that help everyone develop deeper understanding of marketing concepts．The guidelines below will help us accomplish this goal：

## Basic Communication Standards

1．Use professional language appropriate for business education．Practice the communication skills you＇ll need in marketing careers．

2．Do not post anything online that you would feel uncomfortable saying in a professional meeting．Remember that marketing is a relationship－based industry．

3．Always proofread your posts and emails before submitting．Clear communication is essential in marketing．

4．Check D2L daily（including weekends）for group messages and announcements．Respond to group members within 48 hours．

Note：If your communication involves inappropriate language or tone，you will receive one written warning．The same applies to academic dishonesty．After this warning，further inappropriate communication will impact your participation grade．

## Group Discussion Standards

In group case study discussions，demonstrate productive communication by：

## Strong Discussion Examples：

－＂Nike＇s target market segmentation focuses on athletes aged 18－35，which differs from Mayo Clinic＇s patient－centered approach because their value propositions serve completely different needs．＂

Figure 4：Professional teaching website

## Application to Teaching Practice

Course Design Decisions: My MKT 327 structure reflects understanding of MSU student diversity, offering multiple format options and emphasizing clear communication to support students from various backgrounds.

Professional Development Planning: Integration of teaching practice with research interests through Mentored Teaching Project, connecting classroom observations with scholarly inquiry.

Institutional Engagement: Active participation in CCT certification process demonstrates understanding of university's investment in teaching development and commitment to continuous improvement.

## Future Integration

## Short-term Applications:

- Continue utilizing MSU teaching support resources and professional development opportunities
- Maintain alignment between marketing education goals and university mission in future course design
- Develop professional teaching presence that reflects institutional affiliation and values


## Long-term Professional Development:

- Integration of teaching scholarship with disciplinary research in marketing
- Contribution to university teaching community through sharing effective practices
- Understanding of how teaching excellence connects to academic career advancement within university context


## Areas for Continued Growth

From my workshop reflection, I identified specific ongoing questions requiring future investigation:

- Effective pedagogical techniques specific to teaching marketing concepts within university context
- Strategies for addressing students with varying levels of quantitative preparation in diverse university populations
- More varied formative assessment approaches that align with both marketing education and institutional standards
- Finding the right balance between marketing theory and practical applications within land-grant mission
- Addressing potential language and cultural barriers as an international instructor serving diverse student populations
- Better methods to evaluate if teaching approaches achieve stated goals within institutional assessment frameworks


## Evidence of Competency Achievement

Workshop Engagement: Active participation in CCTI sessions and thoughtful reflection on institutional alignment concepts

Practical Application: Evidence in MKT 327 course design of understanding MSU's diverse student population needs and institutional mission

Teaching Philosophy Alignment: Clear connection between personal teaching values and institutional mission, demonstrated through organized, accessible course design

## Conclusion

The Understanding the University Context competency has provided essential framework for situating marketing education within MSU's institutional mission and culture. Through CCTI workshop participation and reflection, I've developed appreciation for how effective teaching requires not just disciplinary expertise and pedagogical skill, but also understanding of institutional context, student population characteristics, and professional development opportunities.

This competency forms the foundation for continued growth as an educator who can navigate university resources, align teaching with institutional mission, and develop professional presence appropriate for academic career advancement within higher education contexts.

## COLA Fellowship Guide

The Colleges' Online Learning Academy (COLA) program is a summer fellowship that allows graduate students to deeply engage with digital teaching and learning in their work. The fellowship consists of a series of workshops, creation of deliverables around your own teaching and learning practice, and review of those deliverables from peers and a teaching mentor. See example deliverables from prior fellows here. There are three overarching themes in the fellowship that you can explore:

- Developing your scholarly teaching identity
- Pedagogical and technological skills in digital teaching and learning
- Accessibility and inclusion in digital teaching and learning

Through the program, COLA fellows will build their teaching portfolios and can fulfill competency workshop requirements for the MSU Certification in College Teaching Program.

## Requirements

Fellows are expected to average five hours of work per week on their COLA tasks. It's important to note that a lot of the deadlines for the fellowship take place in July and August, so consider any travel or other obligations around that time and work ahead as needed in order to ensure you can participate in your cohort's peer review process. While we specifically dedicate one week in July to each deliverable, we recommend getting a head start on your deliverables during weeks in May or June when you are not attending the scheduled workshops.

We will also ask you to engage in a pre- and post-survey of your fellowship experiences for our evaluation and improvement of the COLA fellowship. You can elect to participate in this as part of a research study or choose for your data to be used only for program evaluation and not shared beyond the EDLI team.

## Workshop Reflections

For each of the three (or more) workshops that you attend, you will write a brief reflection to keep in your portfolio. The reflection should include some key takeaways from the workshop and how you will implement what you learned in your teaching practice moving forward, and anything else you want to note. Example reflections are available in the Files tab on the Teams page.

## Deliverables

You will create two deliverables of your choice related to your teaching practice. Past examples of deliverables have included online course modules, syllabi, teaching philosophies, course assignments, and professional websites. To decide what deliverables to create, consider the themes of the fellowship you want to focus on, the course(s) you teach or will teach in the future, and what types of deliverables you might need for the current stage of your graduate program. Both deliverables will become part of your portfolio, and you will share one deliverable with your cohort for peer review. Note that while many of the fellowship tasks can be done on a flexible timeline, the deadline for sharing your deliverable for peer review is firm given the quick turnaround time between peer review and the gallery walk presentations.

## Portfolio

As you finish up your deliverables and peer review, you will compile the materials you have created throughout the fellowship into a portfolio. This portfolio can take many forms, including: a Google Drive folder, a website, a slide deck (potentially with links to other documents or websites), or a PDF. Example portfolios are available in D2L.

Your portfolio should include at least:

- Your three workshop reflections
- Your two deliverables

Your portfolio may also include other artifacts, such as:

- A reflection on how you incorporated peer review into your deliverable(s)
- A teaching philosophy
- Any other documents, websites, or products you developed in the course of this fellowship that you want to maintain in your professional teaching portfolio

Portfolios will be submitted via D2L.

## Gallery Walk Presentation

At the end of the COLA fellowship, you will share a 5 -minute presentation on your COLA experience. The format of presentations is open. You can focus on one deliverable or aspect of your portfolio, provide a broad overview, solicit audience feedback, or whatever you are comfortable with. Example presentations are available in D2L.

We will offer both synchronous and asynchronous formats for engaging in the Gallery Walk. If you participate asynchronously, you could create a video of yourself presenting, add audio to your presentation (we recommend recording in Zoom or PowerPoint with captions enabled so you will have a transcript of the presentation), or ensure you provide lots of context in your presentation so that your audience can easily follow what you are sharing. You will view and comment on a few others' presentations asynchronously as well.
