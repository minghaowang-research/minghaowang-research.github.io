| Full Graduate Student Name: Minghao Wang |  | APID: A49122593 |  |  |  |
| Context for Project (e.g., course name) ${ }^{\text {MKT } 327}$ |  |  |  |  |  |
| Proposed Semester for Project | Summer 2025 |  |  |  |  |
| I am willing to have a link to my ePortfolio shared on the Graduate School website. (YES) NO (circle one) |  |  |  |  |  |
| PROJECT OBJECTIVES: |  |  |  |  |  |
| To investigate the relationship between students' pre-course attitudes toward group work and their actual performance in collaborative case study assignments, with the goal of improving group formation strategies and assessment practices for future course offerings. This research will inform my teaching approach for MKT 327 in Summer 2026 and contribute to broader understanding of collaborative learning effectiveness. |  |  |  |  |  |
| DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT, INCLUDING IMPLEMENTATION, STUDENT OBJECTIVES, TIMELINES, AND YOUR RESPONSIBILITES IN CARRYING OUT THE PROJECT: |  |  |  |  |  |
| Background \& Rationale: In Summer 2025, I modified MKT 327 from individual case studies to group-based collaborative assignments to reduce student workload and foster peer connections in an online environment. This change represents a significant pedagogical shift that warrants systematic evaluation. <br> Research Question: "How do students' initial attitudes toward group work (self-rated collaboration skills and contribution patterns) predict their performance in collaborative case study assignments?" <br> Implementation Timeline: <br> - Week 1 (July 1-6): Collect pre-course survey data on group work attitudes and marketing familiarity <br> - Weeks 1-6: Students complete four group case study assignments worth 400 points total <br> - Week 3 (July 14-20): Collect mid-semester survey data on group collaboration experiences <br> - Week 7 (August 11-15): Analyze relationship between pre-course attitudes and final group performance <br> Student Learning Objectives: <br> - Develop collaborative problem-solving skills through group case analysis <br> - Apply marketing concepts to real-world business scenarios <br> - Build peer connections in an online learning environment <br> - Reflect on their own collaboration patterns and effectiveness <br> My Responsibilities: <br> - Design and implement pre/mid-course surveys measuring group work attitudes <br> - Facilitate group formation process ( 14 groups of 5 students each) <br> - Grade group case studies using consistent rubric <br> - Conduct statistical analysis correlating pre-course attitudes with performance outcomes <br> - Reflect on findings to improve future group formation and support strategies |  |  |  |  |  |

## Data Collection Methods:

- Pre-survey: Group work confidence (1-5 scale), typical contribution patterns, marketing familiarity
- Performance data: Four group case study scores (100 points each)
- Mid-survey: Actual group collaboration experience ratings
- Final grades: Overall course performance

MENTOR'S ROLE IN THE PROJECT, INCLUDING PLANNED MEETINGS AND PROJECT ASSESSMENT:
The mentor will provide guidance on:

- Research design and methodology for correlational analysis
- Statistical analysis approaches (correlation, regression analysis)
- Interpretation of results and pedagogical implications
- Reflection on findings and future teaching applications


## Planned Meetings:

- Initial meeting: Project design and methodology discussion
- Mid-project meeting: Data collection progress and preliminary findings
- Final meeting: Results interpretation and teaching implications

Project Assessment: The mentor will evaluate the project based on:

- Quality of research design and implementation
- Rigor of data analysis and interpretation
- Thoughtful reflection on teaching practice
- Clear articulation of findings and future applications


## METHODS OF ASSESSMENT:

Primary Assessment Method: Correlational analysis examining relationships between:

- Pre-course group work confidence ratings (1-5 scale) and group case study performance
- Self-reported contribution patterns ("contribute much more," "contribute more," "contribute equally," "contribute less") and actual group grades
- Initial marketing familiarity levels and group collaboration success


## Statistical Analysis Plan:

1. Descriptive Statistics: Summarize pre-course attitudes and final performance outcomes
2. Correlation Analysis: Calculate Pearson correlations between attitude variables and performance
3. Regression Analysis: Identify which pre-course factors best predict group success
4. Comparative Analysis: Compare high vs. low performers on initial attitude measures

## Secondary Assessment Methods:

- Mid-semester survey comparing expected vs. actual group collaboration experiences
- Qualitative reflection on patterns observed during group formation and assignment grading
- Analysis of whether initial attitudes help identify students who need additional collaboration support


## Success Metrics:

- Statistical significance of correlations between attitudes and performance
- Effect sizes indicating practical significance of relationships
- Clear patterns that could inform future group formation strategies
- Actionable insights for supporting student collaboration

Data Analysis Software: $R$ for statistical analysis, with results interpreted through pedagogical lens
