Hello Caitlin,
Sure thing! You can use the GitHub website. I updated my GitHub frequently, also the GitHub has a COLA web page.

Subject: Sharing your professional website
Hi Minghao,
I am updating our COLA website, and was wondering whether you'd be okay with us linking to your GitHub and/or Commons site from the COLA site as an example of what prior students have accomplished during the fellowship?

You don't need to worry about keeping the information updated or the website format the same - we will archive the site after the next round of COLA.

I appreciate all the hard work you did over the summer and would love to share!

```
Best,
Caitlin
